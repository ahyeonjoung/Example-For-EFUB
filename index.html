        <h3>가사</h3>
        <p>
            I'm jealous, I'm overzealous <br>
            When I'm down I get real down<br>
            When I'm high I don't come down<br>
            I get angry, baby, believe me<br>
            I could love you just like that<br>
            And I can leave you just as fast<br>
            But you don't, judge me<br>
            'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too<br>
            No you don't, judge me<br>
            'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too<br></p>
        <p>
            'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too<br>
            So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you<br>
            Bask in the glory, of all our problems<br>
            'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em<br>
            Yeah, I got issues<br>
            And one of them is how bad I need you<br></p>
        <p>
            You do shit on purpose<br>
            You get mad and you break things<br>
            Feel bad, try to fix things<br>
            But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit<br>
            And got hands like an ocean<br>
            Push you out, pull you back in<br></p>
        <p>
            'Cause you don't, judge me<br>
            'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too<br>
            No you don't, judge me<br>
            'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too<br></p>
        <p>
            'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too<br>
            So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you<br>
            Bask in the glory, of all our problems<br>
            'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em<br>
            Yeah, I got issues<br>
            And one of them is how bad I need you<br></p>
        <p>
            I got, you got 'em too<br>
            I got issues, you got 'em too<br>
            I got, but you got 'em too (I got 'em)<br>
            I got issues, but you got 'em too (I got 'em)<br></p>
